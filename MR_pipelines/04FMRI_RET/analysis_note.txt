To run prf, usually we do it on DIPC

First we need to parepare the log files using the prepare_prf/01_prepare_prf_vistadisplpg.py


Then we will edit the container specidic json for that particular containers

Then we prepare the json using prepare_prf/prepare_prf_subses_json.py

Then we launch it by run_dipc/sbatch_xxx.sh analysis-name

After the job is done, we will launch the check_prf to check the logs

fmriprep usually we run it on DIPC

move the BIDS files there, as well as check if scans.tsv is there in the BIDS folder

launch it on DIPC cluster using run_dipc/launch_fmriprep_slurm.sh

Pass the correct subseslist there, it will be under base/code

Prepare the bids_filter.json under base/code/fmriprep with subject id, so that you can select sessions

note: if make the subseslist, there needs to have a new line of empty content so that it can 
get all the lines with sub and ses info, needs to fix this


note: the minimal is not working

note: remember to change the sbatch name

note: remeber to put 5 as the dummy-scans

for the nifti prepare,

first we run prepare_func, which will call local_nordic.sh

In the meantime we can run prepare_anat, which we will call local_run_presurfer

When both of them finished, approx 1h for each session, we run prepare_fmap

first we will run python 01_prepare_fmap_folder.py, it will copy and create the sub-/ses-/fmap folder
and copy the scans.tsv file

then we run 02_auto_gen_intendedfor.py to populate the intended for fields in the fmap for fmriprep


For this step, we only need to input subseslist name, i.e. subseslist_sub08.txt

the file will be put under base/code

To run PRF analysis,

1. needs to sync all the stimuli and vistadisplog files from the local experiment PC

stimuli: the .mat file BcblViennaDisplay read
vistadisplog: follow the sub-/ses- structure, are the params.mat files


If prfprepare is point to some freesurfer dir, better to maintain it because the following prfresult will look for that

freesurfer dir needs to be under fmriprep sourcedata

fmriprep dir is hard coded, must be fmriprep/analysis-xxx


For PRFprepare, we need to have sourcedata/stimuli field
